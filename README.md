# Econometrics


⚠️ **WORK IN PROGRESS!** ⚠️

Welcome to my lecture notes for graduate Econometrics! 

These notes were initially born as my personal summary for the PhD Econometrics course of professor [Damian Kozbur](https://www.econ.uzh.ch/en/people/faculty/kozbur.html) in Zurich. The first draft was the result of an intense collaborative effort together with Chiara Aina and Paolo Mengano. They helped a lot in both drafting and revising the original notes. During the years I have expanded the first draft in order to make it more comprehensive and include Julia code examples. I will try to be as transparent as possible on the sources of the material but all errors are mine.
